description: Working conventions
order: 50

- **Adapter work is fixture-first:** hand-write `fixtures/<tool>/expected/` from the
  tool's documented behavior _before_ implementing `detect` → `read` → `write`. Adapter
  regressions are P0; a `format-changed` issue jumps the queue.
- **Adapters import `@rulegate/adapter-kit`, never `@rulegate/core`.** The kit is the
  frozen contract (T011) and every shipped adapter is the proof that it is
  sufficient — the moment one of them reaches past it, it stops being proof. If a symbol
  is missing, add it to the kit: additions are non-breaking, removals cost an
  `ADAPTER_API_VERSION` bump. See `docs/adapter-api-v1.md`. The test harness is a
  separate entry point, `@rulegate/adapter-kit/testing`, because it reads the filesystem
  and adapters must not.
- **Two adapter traps, both now handled — keep them handled.** Codex's `AGENTS.md` is
  both a valid canonical _input_ and that adapter's _output_, so the adapter declines
  when `isCanonicalSource` says the path is the source. Copilot has three competing
  instruction mechanisms and they are _additive_, not an override chain: enabling
  `copilot`, `codex` and `claude-code` together sends Copilot the same rules three times.
  Both facts live in each adapter's `docs`, with source links.
- **This repo dogfoods itself, on every shipped adapter.** Root `CLAUDE.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  are generated artifacts. Edit `.rulegate/rules/` and run `rulegate sync`; never edit
  the generated files, and commit all of them alongside the rule change.
- **Generated output is not formatter territory.** Every generated path is
  listed in `.prettierignore` deliberately: a formatter and a generator cannot both own a
  file. Reformat one and the next `rulegate sync` correctly reports it as hand-edited and
  refuses to write it. Format `.rulegate/rules/` instead.
- Prefer the smallest change that is still correct, and match the surrounding code's
  comment density and idiom. Comments in this codebase explain _why_ a constraint
  exists, not what a line does.
- **Maintainer working notes are not in this repository.** If your checkout has
  `task-breakdown.md` or serena memories, they are git-ignored internal notes — read them
  via `list_memories`/`read_memory`, keep task statuses current, and append to the
  `05-progress-log` memory on every completion. If absent, nothing is missing:
  `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/` hold what a contributor needs.
