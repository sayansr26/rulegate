# Adapter API v1

The contract external adapters are written against is **`@rulegate/adapter-kit`**, and it
is **frozen** as of T011 (2026-09-02). This document is normative: it lists the frozen
surface, defines what counts as a breaking change, and says how a v2 would arrive.

`@rulegate/core` is **not** the contract. It is published because the kit depends on it,
but it carries no compatibility guarantee and its shape will change. Adapter source may not
import it — enforced by `eslint.config.js` and by an invariant scan in
`packages/core/test/invariants.test.ts`.

## What an adapter is

```ts
interface Adapter {
  readonly name: ToolId; // stable kebab-case id, e.g. "claude-code"
  readonly apiVersion: 1;
  detect(ctx: AdapterContext): Promise<DetectResult>; // is this tool used here?
  read(ctx: AdapterContext): Promise<Partial<Canonical>>; // native → canonical
  write(ctx: AdapterContext): Promise<readonly Artifact[]>; // canonical → native
  readonly docs: AdapterDocs; // precedence rules, source links, verified-against
}
```

Adapters are pure: no network, no process spawning, no global state, and **no writes**.
`AdapterContext.fs` is a `ReadOnlyFileSystem`; `write()` returns artifacts rather than
producing them. That is what makes `check` and `sync` structurally incapable of
disagreeing — both consume one rendering pass, and only the pipeline's apply step touches
the disk. `write()` must be deterministic, and `read()` must be lossless.

## Two entry points

| Import                          | Contents                                                               | Frozen? |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `@rulegate/adapter-kit`         | The contract: types, render helpers, determinism primitives, errors    | **Yes** |
| `@rulegate/adapter-kit/testing` | The fixture harness (`renderFixture`, `readExpected`, `contextFor`, …) | No      |

They are separate because the harness reads the filesystem. Re-exporting it from the
contract entry would put `node:fs` and a concrete filesystem into the import graph of every
adapter, through the package whose central rule is that adapters do not touch the disk.

## The frozen surface

Asserted by `packages/adapter-kit/test/public-api.test.ts`, which compares the compiled
export list — types _and_ values — against a literal. Shapes are asserted separately by
`packages/adapter-kit/test/shape/pins.ts`, because a widened return type or a new required
field changes no export name.

**Contract types** — `Adapter`, `AdapterContext`, `AdapterDocs`, `Artifact`, `ArtifactKind`,
`ArtifactDraft`, `DetectResult`, `DirEntry`, `DocNote`, `PrecedenceEntry`,
`ReadOnlyFileSystem`, `SourceLink`, `VerifiedAgainst`.

**Model types** — `Canonical`, `RulegateManifest`, `ManifestOptions`, `ToolConfig`,
`RuleDocument`, `RuleFrontmatter`, `ToolSelector`, `ToolId`, `RuleId`, `JsonValue`,
`SourceRef`.

**Rendering** — `finalizeArtifact`, `renderConcatenated`, `renderRuleSection`,
`SectionOptions`, `DEFAULT_SECTION_OPTIONS`, `sortRules`, `withHtmlMarker`,
`withHashMarker`, `MARKER_TEXT`, `HTML_MARKER`, `HASH_MARKER`.

**Determinism primitives** — `compareCodepoint`, `toPosix`, `joinPosix`, `dirnamePosix`,
`basenamePosix`. These are exported because the alternatives are _banned_, not merely
discouraged: `.localeCompare` is lint-banned repo-wide, and `node:path` is banned in adapter
source because `path.join` emits backslashes on Windows, which would land in `Artifact.path`
and hash straight into `state.json`. A ban is only honest once the lawful alternative ships.

**Selection and predicates** — `selects`, `ALL_TOOLS`, `appliesRepoWide`, `ruleHeading`,
`DEFAULT_RULE_ORDER`, `isCanonicalSource`, `matchesGlob`.

**Errors** — `RulegateError`, `isRulegateError`, `RulegateErrorCode`,
`RulegateErrorInit`. Throw these rather than a bare `Error`, or the CLI prints a stack
trace instead of `file:line:column` and a hint.

**Values** — `ADAPTER_API_VERSION`, `detected`, `NOT_DETECTED`.

### Deliberately excluded

The pipeline (`computePlan`, `applyPlan`, `verifyPlan`), all state handling, the parser,
`serializeCanonical`, the concrete filesystems (`NodeFileSystem`, `MemoryFileSystem`),
repo-root resolution, and `WritableFileSystem`. An adapter that needs one of these is doing
something the contract forbids. `WritableFileSystem` in particular was removed at T011 while
removal was still free: it is the type someone would reach for to write
`ctx.fs as WritableFileSystem` and cast past the invariant the design exists to protect.

### Reserved

`Canonical.skills` is a stub for skills (T057). Its **element type is not part of the
frozen surface** and may change without a major bump until that lands; `Skill` is
deliberately not exported, so an adapter cannot declare against a shape that is not
settled. The field itself — present, and an array — is frozen. Reading it is allowed and
unsupported.

`Canonical.mcpServers` **is no longer reserved.** T043 settled the shape and T045 exported
it, so `McpServer`, `McpTransport`, `EnvRef`, `SecretValue` and `McpScope` are part of the
frozen surface and are pinned key-for-key in `test/shape/pins.ts`.

`RuleFrontmatter.unknown` is the forward-compatibility channel for rule metadata: any
frontmatter key Rulegate does not recognize is preserved there verbatim.

### Writing MCP servers (added at T045)

**No signature changed and `ADAPTER_API_VERSION` did not move.** An MCP-capable adapter is
an ordinary adapter: `read()` already returns `Partial<Canonical>`, so it returns
`{ mcpServers }`; `write()` already returns `readonly Artifact[]`, so it returns one with
`kind: 'mcp'`. **A rules-only adapter needs no edit at all** — that is not a courtesy, it
is the tested property.

Three rules an MCP writer must follow:

- **Render JSON with `stableJsonStringify`.** It is the only JSON writer in the codebase.
  `JSON.stringify` emits keys in insertion order, and an object assembled from a
  filesystem walk inherits that walk's order — nondeterminism hashed straight into
  `state.json`.
- **Carry the marker with `withJsonMarker`.** JSON has no comments, so a generated MCP file
  declares itself with a top-level `"//"` key (`JSON_MARKER_KEY`). It sorts first under
  `compareCodepoint`, so it stays at the top with no special case, and marker presence
  stays a property every generated artifact has.
- **Skip `scope: 'global'` servers.** There is no lawful path for one: `escapesRoot`
  refuses anything outside the repository and `AdapterContext` has no home directory.
  `doctor` reports them; adapters do not write them.

Secrets need no care at all, which is the point: `SecretValue` is `EnvRef`, so an adapter
is never handed a literal. `computePlan` also scans every `kind: 'mcp'` artifact's rendered
bytes and fails the run rather than writing a credential (T044), so an adapter that
constructs one out of `unknown` is caught rather than trusted.

## Compatibility policy

**Breaking** — requires an `ADAPTER_API_VERSION` bump and a major on the kit:

- removing or renaming any export;
- adding a required member to `Adapter`;
- changing the parameter or return type of `detect`, `read`, or `write`;
- changing or removing any required member of `Artifact`, `AdapterContext`, `DetectResult`,
  or `AdapterDocs`, including dropping a `readonly`;
- narrowing any value the contract accepts.

**Non-breaking** — a minor on the kit, `apiVersion` unchanged:

- adding a new export;
- adding an _optional_ member to `AdapterDocs`, `Artifact`, or `RuleFrontmatter`;
- adding a member to `AdapterContext`. Adapters _consume_ contexts, so a new field cannot
  break them — but anything that _constructs_ one (a host, the fixture harness) does break,
  so this still requires a kit minor and a note here.

The asymmetry is the thing to remember: **adding an export costs nothing, removing one costs
a major.** When a symbol's inclusion is arguable, leave it out and add it when an adapter
actually needs it.

## Change log

Additions only. Each is non-breaking under the policy above; `ADAPTER_API_VERSION` is
still 1.

## How v2 would arrive

`ADAPTER_API_VERSION` becomes `2` and `@rulegate/adapter-kit` majors. The host reads
`adapter.apiVersion` before calling `write()` — `packages/core/src/pipeline/plan.ts` — and a
mismatch produces `E_ADAPTER_API_VERSION` naming both versions, without taking down the rest
of the run. That branch is unreachable from TypeScript today, which is the point: it exists
for a plain-JS adapter and for a `node_modules` holding an adapter built against a different
kit, and it is the mechanism by which a v2 host would keep running v1 adapters for at least
one minor after v2 ships.

`@rulegate/core` is explicitly outside all of this and versions independently.

## Writing an adapter

The full walkthrough is [`writing-an-adapter.md`](writing-an-adapter.md). The short version:

Start with the scaffold, from a checkout of this repository:

```
rulegate adapter new <tool>          # prints the plan; writes nothing
rulegate adapter new <tool> --yes    # applies it
pnpm install && pnpm test             # green as generated
```

It creates a working concatenated-Markdown adapter, its three fixture layouts, its tests,
and its registration — the package, the CLI's dependency list, the Vitest alias, and
§4.1 of RFC-0001. Registration is part of the scaffold rather than a follow-up step
because `packages/cli/test/registry.test.ts` asserts that `ADAPTERS` equals the directory
listing: an unregistered adapter fails the suite rather than merely going unused.

What is left is the part only you can write: the real artifact path, the real precedence
rules in `src/docs.ts` (every placeholder there is marked `TODO`, and dated `1970-01-01`
so an unverified claim cannot be mistaken for a verified one), and a hand-written golden.

Fixture-first. Hand-write `fixtures/<tool>/expected/` from the tool's documented behavior
_before_ implementing `detect` → `read` → `write`, then make the fixture pass byte-exact.
Encode the tool's precedence rules in `docs`, each with a source URL and the tool version
verified against — that data powers `rulegate doctor` and the per-tool documentation pages.
Finally, confirm the generated config actually loads in the real tool, and record that you
did.
