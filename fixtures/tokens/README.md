# `tokens` fixtures

Five frozen documents and their true `cl100k_base` token counts, used to hold
`estimateTokens` (T024) inside ±15%.

## Provenance of `reference.json`

Counts were produced on **2026-09-04** with **`gpt-tokenizer` 4.0.0**, encoding
**`cl100k_base`**, over the byte-exact files in `documents/`.

## Why the counts are re-derived rather than trusted

`token-accuracy.test.ts` calls the reference tokenizer itself and compares against
`reference.json`. Committing the numbers *and* re-deriving them may look redundant; it is
not. A committed number that nothing recomputes can be wrong forever, and the tempting way
to "fix" a failing accuracy test is to regenerate the expectation from the estimator — at
which point the test measures whether the estimator agrees with itself.

So there is **no `tokens:update` script**, by design. If a count here is ever wrong, it is
meant to be inconvenient to change.

## Why these five documents

| File | What it stresses |
|---|---|
| `01-claude-md.md` | this repository's own generated `CLAUDE.md` — the population `doctor` actually measures |
| `02-canonical-rule.md` | a canonical `.rulegate/rules/*.md` source: prose, dense inline code |
| `03-cursor-rule.mdc` | the `.mdc` dialect — frontmatter, bare globs |
| `04-prose-and-tables.md` | long prose with Markdown tables and headings |
| `05-adversarial.md` | long paths and globs, fenced TS and JSON, dense CJK/Hangul/Kana, Cyrillic, Greek, many ZWJ emoji sequences, a punctuation run, a very long line, and a CRLF section |

`AGENTS.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are deliberately **absent**: in this
repository all three are byte-identical to `CLAUDE.md` (T073 — the same 6,516 characters
and 1,637 tokens), so a fourth copy would have added a fixture that tests nothing.

### How adversarial `05` has to be

The first draft of it was not adversarial at all: `chars / 4` estimated it to within 9.5%,
so the control asserting that a naive estimator *fails* had nothing to catch. The CJK and
emoji sections were too small a share of the document. It now carries enough of both that
`chars / 4` is **-34%** on it, which is the point of the file existing.

The estimator was **not** retuned afterwards. Its constants were fitted before this
content was written, and it holds at -4.5% on the harder document — so that number is a
generalization result rather than a fit.

## These are frozen copies, not live reads

Documents 01–04 are copies of files that `rulegate sync` regenerates. A test that read
them from their real locations would have its input change under it whenever a rule was
edited — and a test whose input drifts is a test whose failure means nothing.

`.gitattributes` carries `fixtures/** -text` and `fixtures/**` is in `.prettierignore`, so
these keep their exact bytes. That matters most for `05-adversarial.md`, whose final
section is CRLF on purpose.
