/**
 * The public adapter contract. **Frozen at T011** (2026-09-02): external contributors
 * write against these exports, so a change here breaks them. See `README.md` in this
 * package for the compatibility policy, and `packages/adapter-kit/test/public-api.test.ts`
 * (the export list) plus `test/contract-shape.test.ts` (the shape of each export) for the
 * two guards that enforce it.
 *
 * The definitions live in `@rulegate/core`; this package re-exports them, which keeps
 * the declared dependency direction (adapter-kit -> core) intact. The test of whether
 * this surface is the right one is mechanical: an adapter must be writable against this
 * package alone, and the two shipped adapters are the proof — no adapter source file may
 * import `@rulegate/core` at all, enforced by eslint and by an invariant scan.
 *
 * When in doubt, leave a symbol out. Adding an export later is additive; removing one is
 * a breaking change that costs an `apiVersion` bump.

// `read()` already returns `Partial<Canonical>` and `write()` already returns artifacts,

// `kind: 'mcp'` from the other. A rules-only adapter needs no edit at all, which is T045's
// stated validation.

// `SecretValue` is `EnvRef` and nothing else, which is what makes "never write a literal
