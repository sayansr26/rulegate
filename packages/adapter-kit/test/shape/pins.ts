/**
 * Structural pins for the frozen v1 contract.
 *
 * Not a `.test.ts` on purpose: vitest transpiles without type-checking, so a type-level
 * assertion placed in a test file would be silently inert. `contract-shape.test.ts`
 * compiles this file with the TypeScript API and asserts zero semantic diagnostics, so
 * every `Exact<>` below is genuinely checked.
 *
 * These catch what the export-name golden cannot: a widened return type, a narrowed
 * parameter, a field that became optional, or a new required member — none of which
 * changes a single export name. `DetectResult.evidence` is the concrete case the project
 * has already lived through (see the T006 change note in
 * the `07-api-documentation` maintainer memory).
 *
 * A pin is deliberately a hand-written copy, not a reference to the real type. Comparing
 * a type to itself proves nothing; the duplication is the assertion.
