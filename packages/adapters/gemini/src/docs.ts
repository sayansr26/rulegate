/**
 * Encoded precedence knowledge for the Gemini CLI.
 *
 * Gemini's model is *concatenation*, not selection: every context file it finds is joined
 * and sent with each prompt, with the more specific ones later. So `files` ranked
 * highest-first here means "wins a conflict", not "is the only one read" — which is
 * exactly the distinction `doctor` exists to make visible, since a user who assumes
 * override semantics will not understand why a deleted-from-the-root rule still applies.
