/**
 * T014's self-reference trap, at the layer a real repository actually hits.
 *
 * `packages/adapters/codex/test/self-reference.test.ts` proves the adapter declines on its
 * own. This proves the whole pipeline does — with the real registry, so it also catches the
 * case where some *other* adapter starts claiming `AGENTS.md` and reintroduces the bug from
 * outside the codex package.
 *
 * The scenario is not exotic: a repository with no `.rulegate/` and a hand-written
 * `AGENTS.md` is the single most likely first contact anyone has with this tool, and
 * `parse` promotes that file to `canonicalSources` precisely so this cannot happen.
