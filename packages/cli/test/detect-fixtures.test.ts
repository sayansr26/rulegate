 * output matches expectation, and a filesystem spy confirms zero writes outside the repo.
 *
 * This lives in the CLI package rather than in core because core must not depend on the
 * adapters — eslint bans `@rulegate/adapter-*` in `packages/core/src`, and the dependency
 * direction is `cli → adapters → kit → core`. Core owns the algorithm; the CLI owns the
 * roster of adapters this build ships. Moving this file into core would invert that.
