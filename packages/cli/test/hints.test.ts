/**
 * A hint is advice we tell the user to follow. `sync` used to hint at
 * `rulegate sync --import`, which is T045 and unimplemented, so following it produced
 * usage help and exit 2 — the code reserved for "you made a mistake" (T069). A README
 * promise decays; this does not.
 *
 * Subcommands are covered too, as of T019. They could not be until then: two hints and
 * RFC §8 named `rulegate init` while it was unregistered, so following the only
 * instruction a user with no `.rulegate/` ever received exited **2** (T071). Widening
 * this guard is how that stays fixed.

/**
 * Both channels a hint can reach the user through: `RulegateError.hint`, and the CLI's

 * errors is what makes this cover hints no test happens to trigger.
 *
 * The window is expression-shaped rather than line-shaped on purpose. Hint text is
 * routinely a `'…' + '…'` concatenation split across two lines, and a line-based scan
 * reads only the first half — which is exactly the half that tends not to hold the flag.
 * It ends at the first line that closes the enclosing call or object literal, which is
 * how every hint in this codebase is written. Over-reading slightly is the safe
 * direction: it can only make this test louder, never quieter.
