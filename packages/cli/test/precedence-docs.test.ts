 * T025: every claim about what a tool reads carries a source URL and the version it was
 * verified against, so a reviewer can check it and a stale entry is visible rather than
 * silently wrong.
 *
 * Driven off `ADAPTERS` rather than a hardcoded list. `registry.test.ts` already pins
 * `ADAPTERS` to the directory listing under `packages/adapters/`, so a sixth adapter is
 * covered here the day it is registered — a guard that quietly narrows its own scope while
 * staying green is worse than no guard.

 * Which write fixtures hold each adapter's goldens.
 *
 * Convention first — `fixtures/<tool>/` — with an entry here only for an adapter whose
 * output does not all live there. Cursor is the one: `.cursorrules` is opt-in
 * (`options.legacy`), so its goldens are split across two fixture repos. A hardcoded
 * roster used to live here and had to be edited by hand for every adapter, which a
 * scaffolded one (T028) would have failed on the day it landed.
