/**
 * Two gates, and they catch different things.
 *
 * `--check` is a **byte** gate: it proves the committed pages are what the current
 * `docs.ts` renders. It cannot tell you the renderer is *right* — a renderer that silently
 * dropped every description would stay green forever, because the committed pages would
 * have dropped them too.
 *
 * So the assertions below are a **semantic** gate, and they deliberately assert on fields
 * that appear in exactly one place on the page. Asserting `pattern` or `source.url` would
 * prove nothing: those appear in the precedence table *and* the per-file sections *and* the
 * Sources list, so a mutation removing any one section would still find them somewhere.
