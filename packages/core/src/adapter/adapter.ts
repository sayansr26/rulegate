 * a literal that is not a credential, a `${NAME:-default}` reference, a `${input:}` — and
 * an adapter that silently returned fewer servers than the file contains would be exactly
 * the quiet loss this project refuses everywhere else. Strings rather than
 * `RulegateError`s because these are not failures: `init` prints them and continues.
