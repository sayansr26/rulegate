 * A file an adapter says *should* exist, with its complete contents.
 *
 * Adapters return these; they never write. That is the mechanism behind the project's
 * single most important structural constraint: `sync` applies the artifacts and
 * `check` compares against them, so the two commands consume byte-identical output
 * from one rendering pass and cannot drift apart. If an adapter could write directly,
 * `check` would be verifying something other than what `sync` produces — and `check`
 * would be lying.
