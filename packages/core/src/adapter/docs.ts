 * Whether one file supersedes the others, or they are all sent together.

 * `'override'` is the default because it is what a reader assumes, and stating the
 * assumption is cheaper than a field every adapter has to set.
 *
 * The three are genuinely different, and the distinction between the first two is the one
 * that took a real tool to surface (T044a):
 *
 * - `'additive'` — every present file is sent. Ordering ranks specificity, not authority.
 * - `'override'` — every present file is still **sent**, and the nearest one wins a
 *   *conflict*. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.local.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
 *   together; a shadowed file loses the argument and still costs its tokens.
 * - `'first-match'` — the tool opens the **first file that exists and stops**. The rest are
 *   never read, so they cost nothing and contribute nothing. Zed's nine-file chain is the
 *   first of these in the roster, and modelling it as `'override'` would make `doctor`
 *   report eight files as loaded that Zed never opens, and bill the user for them.
 *
 * Added 2026-09-04 (T044a). A new union member is a non-breaking addition per
 * `docs/adapter-api-v1.md`: no existing adapter declares it, and every existing value keeps
 * its meaning.

   * This field exists because "highest precedence first" was quietly describing two

   * one, so index 0 is the only one that matters. For Copilot, Codex and Gemini every
   * matching file is sent *at once* — Copilot's own documentation is explicit that a
   * path-specific file is applied **in addition to** the repository-wide one — so the
   * order ranks specificity, not authority, and a reader who assumes override semantics
   * cannot explain why a rule they deleted still applies.
   *
   * The distinction is what `doctor` needs to answer "which files are all being sent at
   * once", which is the question T072 records: with all five adapters enabled, `CLAUDE.md`,
   * `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md` are byte-identical here and Copilot loads three of them
   * together. Deriving that warning from this field rather than hardcoding it for Copilot
   * is what makes a sixth adapter covered without a code change.
