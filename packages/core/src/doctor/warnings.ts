/**
 * T078: one tool loading the same content more than once.
 *
 * Derived from the tool's declared `files`, the `managed` claims of *every* adapter, and
 * the bytes on disk — never from a list of tools known to have the problem. That is the
 * requirement rather than a stylistic preference: a sixth adapter that reads another
 * adapter's output gets this warning without a line of code, and a hardcoded rule would go
 * stale the first time a vendor changed its loading behaviour.
 *
 * Byte-identity is the test, not mere co-ownership, because it is the claim that survives
 * scrutiny: two adapters writing genuinely different files to a tool is not waste, and
 * saying it is would train people to ignore the warning.
 */
/**
 * What makes two loaded files the same context, twice.
 *
 * **Byte identity was the wrong question, and using it was the bug (T084).** It catches
 * `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md`, which are identical concatenations, and misses
 * every adapter that writes one file per rule: Cline reads `AGENTS.md` on top of
 * `.clinerules/*.md`, and Roo Code reads it on top of `.roo/rules/*.md` — the same canonical
 * rules, sent twice, in different bytes. The warning stayed silent exactly where the token
 * cost was real, and both adapters shipped a hand-written `docs` note as a workaround.
 *
 * Set *equality* is not enough either: `AGENTS.md` carries the union of what five
 * `.clinerules` files carry, so no two of those files have the same rule set. The question
 * is per **rule** — is this rule reaching the model from more than one file? —  which is
 * what `Artifact.provenance.ruleIds` answers directly.
 *
 * A file with no provenance (a global file, an unmanaged one, anything Rulegate did not
 * generate) is keyed by its content hash instead, which is the only signal available for it
 * and is still correct for the identical-concatenation case.

 * files as data — a golden fixture tree above all, where a `CLAUDE.md` is test input rather
 * than a rule anything loads — and there is no way to tell that from the file. The record
