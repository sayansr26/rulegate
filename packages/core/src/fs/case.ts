/**
 * Path identity on a case-insensitive filesystem (T085).
 *
 * `computePlan` has case-folded its artifact-path conflict key since T069, because two
 * artifacts differing only in case are two entries for **one physical file** on APFS and
 * NTFS. Nothing downstream agreed: `state.json` lookups and `compareToDisk` matched paths
 * exactly, so a recorded `CLAUDE.md` and a planned `claude.md` were treated as two files —
 * which made `sync` refuse to write one of them as `unmanaged` *and* delete the other as an
 * orphan, both being the same file on disk.
 *
 * Two rules keep this from becoming a general "paths are case-insensitive" policy, which
 * would be wrong:
 *
 * 1. **Fold the lookup key, never the stored value.** A `StateArtifact.path` is written
 *    into a committed file and is what every message names; lower-casing it would put a
 *    spurious diff in every adopted repository and report a filename nobody has. Only map
 *    and set keys are folded.
 * 2. **Fold only where the filesystem actually folds.** On ext4 `CLAUDE.md` and
 *    `claude.md` are two real files, and treating them as one would leave a stale artifact
 *    on disk at exit 0 — the exact wrong answer T073 exists to fix. So the answer comes
 *    from `probeCaseInsensitive`, which asks the filesystem, rather than from
 *    `process.platform`, which is not evidence: a case-sensitive volume can be mounted on
 *    macOS and a case-insensitive one on Linux.
 *
 * Folding for *identity* is not folding for *order*. Every sort stays on
 * `compareCodepoint`; see `docs/determinism.md`.
