/**
 * A read-only, repo-sandboxed view of the filesystem.
 *
 * All paths are repo-relative and POSIX-separated; absolute paths and paths escaping
 * the repository root throw E_PATH_ESCAPE. Text reads are BOM-stripped and
 * EOL-normalized to \n, so a CRLF checkout parses to the same model as an LF one.
 * Listings are sorted by codepoint rather than returned in filesystem order — sorting
 * lives here so that determinism is a property of the boundary, not a discipline every
 * adapter author has to remember.
 *
 * Case is **not** normalized: the paths in and out are whatever the caller and the
 * filesystem use. Whether two names differing only in case are one file is a property of
 * the filesystem, answered by `probeCaseInsensitive` in `fs/case.ts` and applied to
 * lookup keys only. Do not key a map on a path without deciding which of the two you
 * mean — getting that wrong is T077.
 *
 * There is deliberately no write method. Adapters receive this interface and return
 * Artifacts; only the pipeline's apply step writes. That is what makes `check` and
 * `sync` structurally incapable of diverging.
