/**
 * The one directory in shipped source allowed to spawn a process, and the allowlist in
 * `packages/core/test/invariants.test.ts` has exactly one entry so it stays that way.
 *
 * `check --staged` has to read the git index, and there is no way to read it without
 * running `git` — the index is a binary format git reserves the right to change, and
 * parsing it ourselves would be a second implementation of somebody else's file format
 * inside a tool that promises to be boring. T023 deferred the flag rather than widen the
 * ban casually; this is that widening, made as narrow as it can be:
 *
 * - `execFile`, never `exec`. No shell, so no argument is ever parsed as a command, and a
 *   path containing `;` or `$(…)` is an ordinary argument.
 * - Arguments are an array. Nothing is interpolated into a command string anywhere here.
 * - Only three git subcommands are ever run, all of them read-only: `rev-parse`,
 *   `ls-files`, `cat-file`. None of them writes to the repository or the index.
 * - **`zero network calls` still holds, and it is now a stronger claim than a file scan.**
 *   `git fetch` and a submodule update are both one argument away, so the argument arrays
 *   here are fixed rather than assembled from user input, and `staged.test.ts` asserts the
 *   set of subcommands this module can run.

/**
 * A read-only view of the git **index**, shaped as an ordinary `ReadOnlyFileSystem`.
 *
 * Shaping it this way is the whole design. `check --staged` then differs from `check` by
 * one argument — which filesystem it hands to `computePlan` and `verifyPlan` — and every
 * structural guarantee those two carry is inherited rather than re-argued: `computePlan`
 * is still the only renderer, so `--staged` cannot verify something `sync` would not
 * produce, and the object has no write method to call.
 *
 * **Both sides come from the index, deliberately.** The question a pre-commit hook is
 * asking is "if this commit lands, is the repository in sync?", so the canonical source
 * is read from the index too. Rendering from the working tree and comparing against the
 * index would report drift for a rule edited but not staged — a correct answer to a
 * question nobody asked, arriving as a blocked commit.
