/**
 * T051 — merge a hand-edit on a generated file back into `.rulegate/`.
 *
 * Hand-editing generated files is a habit users will not break, and today the only way out
 * is to delete your own edit. That is the one outcome worse than doing nothing, so this is
 * the escape hatch T075 has been waiting on.
 *
 * **`state.json` records a hash, not the ancestor text**, and a three-way merge needs the
 * ancestor's *content*. That gives two situations that must not be blurred:
 *
 * - The recorded hash still equals the hash of what canonical renders *now*. Then the
 *   render **is** the ancestor: the file we wrote is reconstructible, the only thing that
 *   moved is the user's edit, and reversing that edit through `adapter.read()` is
 *   well-founded.
 * - The recorded hash does not match. Canonical has moved on too, both sides changed, and
 *   there is no ancestor text anywhere — only a hash proving the common version is gone.
 *   **Refuse and show both sides.** Reconstructing an ancestor by guesswork is precisely
 *   how a silent clobber gets in, and "never silently clobber" is this task's own
 *   requirement.
