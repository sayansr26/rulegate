 * `packages/core` fails with `E_NO_CANONICAL_SOURCE` and hints `rulegate init` — advice
 * that would create a second, nested `.rulegate/`.
 *
 * The answer is the **outermost** canonical root, not the nearest one (T062): a nested
 * level inherits its ancestors' rules, so stopping at `packages/a/.rulegate` would render
 * that package without the repository's conventions and make the same artifact depend on
 * which directory the command was typed in. `--cwd packages/a` is still taken literally
 * and is the way to ask for one level alone.
 *
 * `.git` is a *terminator*, not merely a candidate: the walk never looks above it. That is
 * what keeps "sync never writes outside the repo" true. It is matched as a file as well as
 * a directory, because worktrees and submodules write `.git` as a file containing
 * `gitdir:`, and an `isDirectory()` check would silently climb straight past them.
 *
 * `AGENTS.md` is deliberately not a marker. It decides what the canonical *source* is
 * (RFC-0001 §8), not where the repository is, and it is a common enough filename that an
 * unrelated ancestor's copy could otherwise redirect every write. Once `.git` fixes the
 * root, `parse()` finds `AGENTS.md` there exactly as before.
 *
 * Mount boundaries are an explicit non-goal: detecting them needs a `dev` comparison at
 * every level, behaves differently on Windows, and would refuse bind-mounted container
 * workspaces where a repository legitimately spans a mount.
 *
 * When nothing is found, the starting directory is returned unchanged — never `/`, never
 * the home directory — so the resulting `E_NO_CANONICAL_SOURCE` still describes where the
 * user is standing and `rulegate init` still creates `.rulegate/` there.
