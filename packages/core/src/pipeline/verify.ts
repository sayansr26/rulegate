/**
 * Compare what is on disk against what the plan says should be there. Reads only.
 *
 * `rulegate check` (T023) is this function plus an exit code. It consumes the identical
 * `Plan.artifacts` array that `sync` applies, so it is structurally incapable of verifying
 * something `sync` would not produce — and the rule for `clean` is the other half of that
 * promise: **clean means `sync` would write nothing and delete nothing.** A path is out of
 * sync if the bytes on disk differ from the render, or if `state.json` records a file no
 * adapter produces any more and it is still on disk.
 *
 * That is two comparisons, not one. `compareToDisk` answers the ownership question — is
 * this path ours, and are the bytes still the ones we wrote? — which is what `sync` needs
 * to decide whether it *may* write. It does not answer whether it *would*: a rule edited
 * without a `sync` leaves its artifact matching the recorded hash and differing from the
 * render, which `compareToDisk` files under `unchanged` and which is the case `check`
 * exists for. So ownership comes from `compareToDisk` and the verdict comes from the
 * render hash, per planned path.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately *not* drift. A `state.json` that would be rewritten (an
 * orphan already gone from disk, a stale record for bytes that already match) — state is
 * regenerable, never authoritative. And a CRLF copy of a clean artifact: reads are
 * EOL-normalized, `hashContents` is EOL-blind, and `sync` would not rewrite it, so
 * `check` must not fail a Windows checkout for a difference `sync` does not see.
