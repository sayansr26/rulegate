 * Never write a literal secret (T044). This is the third of three enforcement points.
 *
 * The first is the type system — `SecretValue` is `EnvRef`, so an adapter cannot be
 * *handed* a literal. The second is the parser, which refuses one in `env` or `headers`.
 * Neither closes the hole this module exists for: `McpServer.unknown` holds arbitrary
 * `JsonValue`, preserved verbatim so a round trip loses nothing, and a string in there
 * reaches generated output without passing a single `SecretValue`. Losslessness and "no
 * literal secrets" pull in opposite directions exactly here, and this is where the second
 * one wins.
 *
 * **Nothing in this module ever returns or logs the offending value.** Every result is a
 * key path. A scanner that quoted what it found would print the secret into CI logs,
 * which is the failure it exists to prevent, committed to a different file.
