/**
 * Case-insensitive path identity (T085).
 *
 * The defect these guard: `computePlan` has case-folded its conflict key since T069, but
 * `state.json` lookups and `compareToDisk` matched exactly. On APFS and NTFS a recorded
 * `CLAUDE.md` and a planned `claude.md` are **one physical file**, so the same run filed it
 * under `unmanaged` (refusing to write it, on the grounds that it was somebody else's) and
 * under `orphaned` (deleting it, on the grounds that it was ours).
 *
 * Every case here is paired with its control on a case-sensitive filesystem, where
 * `CLAUDE.md` and `claude.md` really are two files and the old answers are the right ones.
 * Without the pair a fold that fired everywhere would pass, and that fold is wrong: it
 * would stop reporting a genuinely stale artifact as an orphan on ext4, leaving it on disk
 * at exit 0 for the tool it was written for to keep loading — which is T073's bug.
