/**
 * Symlinks, and the two things Rulegate got wrong about them (T064).
 *
 * Both are **platform-independent bugs** found while auditing for Windows, which is the
 * useful half of that audit: path separators and CRLF were already handled everywhere, and
 * what the audit actually turned up was a repo that imports zero rules and a `sync` that
 * writes through a link.
 *
 * Skipped where the platform refuses to create a symlink — Windows without developer mode
 * — because a test that silently passes on an unprivileged runner is worse than one that
 * says it was skipped. `RULEGATE_REQUIRE_SYMLINKS=1` turns the skip into a failure, which
 * is how CI asserts the coverage actually ran somewhere.

 * Windows' 260-character limit surfaces as a raw ENAMETOOLONG naming no limit and
 * suggesting no action. `check` failing with a bare errno on Windows and succeeding on
 * Linux is a bug report nobody can act on, so `io/node.ts` maps it to a named error.
 *
 * Which path a platform *refuses*, and with which errno, is not portable — and the
 * original single test assumed both were. It built a ~1240-character path, which only
 * macOS rejects (PATH_MAX 1024); Linux allows 4096 and the Windows runners have long paths
 * enabled, so it passed on a third of the matrix and asserted nothing on the rest. Worse,
 * making it fail honestly showed that Windows reports an over-long path as ENOENT, so the
 * mapping had never once fired on the platform whose limit it names.
 *
 * So the platform-dependent half is separated from the half Rulegate owns: the mappings
 * are stubbed and must hold identically everywhere, while the one test that asks a real
 * filesystem to refuse something is allowed to skip — out loud — where it will not.
