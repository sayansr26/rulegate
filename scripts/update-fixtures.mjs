/**
 * Regenerate `fixtures/<tool>/expected/` and `fixtures/<tool>-import/expected/` from the
 * current adapters — the first from `write()`, the second from `read()`.
 *
 * Lives at the repo root, not in `packages/`, and that is deliberate:
 * `packages/core/test/invariants.test.ts` allows filesystem writes only in
 * `core/src/io/`, `pipeline/apply.ts` and `fs/types.ts`, and it scans `packages/`. Putting
 * a writer inside `adapter-kit` would have meant widening that allowlist — weakening a
 * P0 invariant to make a dev script convenient. A published package that adapters depend
 * on should not contain a filesystem writer, for the same reason `AdapterContext` has no
 * writer.
 *
 * Regenerating is never a substitute for hand-authoring a new golden. A fixture written
 * by the adapter it is supposed to check proves only that the adapter agrees with itself;
 * `expected/` is hand-written from the tool's documented behavior first, and this script
 * exists for the case where an intended change touches many fixtures at once.
 *
 * Usage: pnpm build && pnpm fixtures:update [tool] [--yes]
